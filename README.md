Spot the Difference Game
A fun "Spot the Difference" game built with React! The game presents two images side by side, and the player has to click on the areas where they spot differences between the two images. The game includes a countdown timer, and the player has 60 seconds to find all the differences. The game ends when all differences are found or when time runs out.

Timer: 60-second countdown to add some challenge.
Click-to-mark: Click on areas of the images to mark differences.

How to Play
Youâ€™ll see two images displayed side-by-side.
Your goal is to click on the areas where you notice differences.
Each time you click on a difference, it will be marked on both images.
You have 60 seconds to find all the differences. Once the time runs out, the game will end.
If you find all the differences before time runs out, you'll be congratulated for winning.
Technologies Used
React: The front-end framework used to build the game.
CSS: Basic styling for the layout and the game's interactive elements.
Game Logic
Timer: A countdown timer is used to challenge players to find the differences quickly.
Click Event: When the player clicks on the image, the app checks whether they clicked near a defined difference. If so, the difference is marked as found.
Game Over Logic: The game ends when either all differences are found or the timer reaches zero.
